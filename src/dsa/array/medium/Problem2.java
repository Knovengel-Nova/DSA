    Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
    n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
